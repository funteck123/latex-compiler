\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the \textbf{AI/ML Engineer} position at \textbf{Tech Company Inc.}, as advertised on \href{URL-to-job-posting}{LinkedIn}. Tech Company Inc.'s leadership in \textbf{innovative AI solutions for the healthcare industry} particularly excites me.

During my tenure at \textbf{Previous Company}, I led a project that boosted model accuracy by \textbf{15\%} using \textbf{TensorFlow} with advanced techniques like convolutional neural network optimization, leading to a \textbf{10\%} decrease in diagnostic errors. I also developed a high-throughput object detection system using \textbf{PyTorch} and YOLOv5 architecture, processing \textbf{10,000+} medical images per minute, significantly improving analysis speed. Furthermore, I utilized \textbf{scikit-learn} for feature selection and model evaluation in machine learning pipelines, cutting down model development time by \textbf{20\%}.

I am confident my track record of delivering measurable improvements and my expertise in applying AI/ML to solve critical problems align well with the goals of Tech Company Inc.

Thank you for your time. I am keen to discuss how I can contribute to your team and am available for a quick call or GMeet to further explore this opportunity.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\signature{Your Name}
