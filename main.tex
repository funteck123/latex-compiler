Upnyx Innovative Solutions\\
 }

\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

I am writing to express my keen interest in the AI/ML Intern position at Upnyx Innovative Solutions. As a Computer Science student at the University of Malaya specializing in AI, I am particularly drawn to Upnyx's commitment to providing innovative AI solutions for businesses, and excited about the opportunity to contribute to your new AI project, especially in areas like AI chatbot development.

My experience includes optimizing machine learning models using TensorFlow and PyTorch, and developing AI applications.  Notably, in a research role at Universiti Malaya Medical Centre, I engineered full-stack LLM pipelines, achieving a 20x performance improvement in image recognition tasks.  This was accomplished using deep learning techniques and frameworks such as YOLOv7. My projects have honed my skills in Python and strengthened my analytical and problem-solving abilities, which I am eager to apply at Upnyx.

I am enthusiastic about the prospect of discussing how my skills and passion for AI can support Upnyx Innovative Solutions.  I am available for a quick call or GMeet to discuss this further at your earliest convenience.
